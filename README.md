This repository contains a few applets I wrote in the fall of 2018 in order to illustrate some linear algebraic concepts for my students. They cover
[linear transformations](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~liban/t19f340/applets/lineartransformations/LinearTransformations.html),
[coordinates](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~liban/t19f340/applets/coordinates/Coordinates.html), and
[coordinate transforms](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~liban/t19f340/applets/transitionmatrices/TransitionMatrices.html) (currently hosted on my UW math dept site).
